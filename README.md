# full-stack-talent-path

A full-stack template repository for Talent Path full-stack immersive training.

## Full-Stack Requirements

A recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (hereafter, "Node") is recommended; a long-term support version of Node.js is required.

```sh
âžœ node -v
v12.11.1
```

Node is used for both our front-end and back-end. This gives us the ability to do neat things, like [universal JS]() or [isomorphic JS](), [server-side rendering]() of [React.js]() client applications, and [real-time]() applications.

<!-- TODO Switch to Typescript since it's a superset of Babel -->

**What about me?** You should bring to the table a working knowledge of JavaScript as a language in both browser and server environments. Eventually, you will also need to have a basic understanding of persistence and authentication, as we aim to provide that for you.

## Back-End Stack & Features

<!-- TODO Clean this up, maybe as a table? Add links. -->

Routing, persistence, models, views, api, logging, testing, security, authentication

- Express with helmet, pino, body-parser
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB

## Front-End Stack & Features

Routing, advanced state management, logging, testing, security, authentication

- React with router, redux
